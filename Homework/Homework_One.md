## Overview and Origin

Ethereum was conceived, by Canadian programmer Vitalik Buterin, in 2013 at just 19 years of age. He published the whitepaper in 2014, titled 'Ethereum: A Next-Genergation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform'. Development commenced in 2014 and the Ethereum network officially went live on 30 July 2015.

**Who are the founders of the company?**

Alongside Vitalik, there were four additional founders of Ethereum in 2013, namely; Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di lorio, Mihai Alisie and Amir Chetrit. In 2014, another three additional founders joined the project, namely; Gavin Wood, Joseph Lubin and Jeffrey Wilcke. 

**How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**

Vitalik was an early adopter in Bitcoin, co-founding the Bitcoin Magazine in 2011 whilst in College. He became an expert on blockchain technology, travelling around the world to meet with an array of bitcoin developers. He soon realised that bitcoin held severe limitations in terms of functionality, noting the blockchain was utilised solely as a means of decentralised currency. He proposed that a new blockchain, with an inbuilt programming language, could be utilised for a much larger range of decentralised applications. As a result, Ethereum was proposed and solidity was developed as the programming language which powers the network.

**How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**

Ethereum was funded by an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of Ether Tokens from July-August 2014. Ether is the cryptocurrency which facilitates payments/transactions on the Ethereum network. Individuals purchased Ether utilising bitcoin during the public sale, however did not immediately receive the tokens as the Ethereum blockchain was not yet live. This event was called a "premine", where individuals instead received Ethereum wallets and passwords which would hold their Ether once the network went live. During the ICO, 12 million Ether were premined for developers and 60 million were premined for ICO participants. The price was $0.31 per coin, raising over $16 Million USD for the project. Today the total supply of ETH is curently 120.11M, meaning approximately 60% of the supply was pre-mined.

## Business Activities:

**What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**

Ethereum was designed to allow for the creation of decentralised applications (dApps) which are trustworthy, transparent and crypto-graphically secure. By removing intermediaries and third parties, dApps provide privacy, remove censorship and reduce or remove uneccessary fees and processing delays. Numerous financial technologies have already been revolutionised utilising Ethereum with examples such as decentralised crypto exchanges, non-fungible-tokens and marketplaces, dentralised finance including lending and borrowing activities and stablecoins. 

**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**

Ethereum was created to enable developers to build dApps which will ultimately be used in a wide arrange of industries, for customers all across the world. Anyone can interact with the Ethereum network, whether it be developers, users, buyers, sellers, traders, collectors and more. In terms of the Eth token, the cryptocurrency is currently the second largest in the world (second to bitcoin) with a current market cap of $229 Billion USD. The total crypto market is currently $1.14 Trillion USD (as of 2145, 17 Aug 22 AEST), meaning Eth holds a market share of approximately 20%. For reference, the bitcoin market cap is currently $454 Billion USD, equating to a share of approximately 40%.

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**

Ethereum has a number of prominent competitors, the most popular of which is Cardano. After disagreements surrounding the direction of Ethereum, co-founder Charles Hoskinson left the project and launched Cardano. Both networks provide the infastructure to support decentralised applications (along with other competitors such as Solana, Tezos and Polkadot). The main advantage of Ethereum is the sheer market size as a result of being the first to market. Far more developers and customers are utilising the Ethereum network with 1.1 Million daily transactions, compared with only 75 Thousand for Cardano.


**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)**

Ethereum utilises blockchain technology, which is a distributed, immutable ledger. Solidity is the programming language developed for and in-built to the Ethereum blockchain. Solodity is defined as 'an object-oriented programming language for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms'.

The Ethereum network currently utilses a proof of work (PoW) consensus to validate and add transactions onto the blockchain. This is due to transition to a proof of stake (PoS) mechanism under Ethereum 2.0.

## Landscape:

**What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**

Ethereum is within the Blockchain industry and Ether is within the Cryptocurrency industry (both intrinsically linked).

**What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**

Blockchain as a technology was only introduced in October of 2008, by an individual, or group of individuals, under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi was responsible for the development of Bitcoin, the world's first cryptocurrency, the genesis block of which was mined on 03 January 2009. Over the proceeding decade, the crypto industry has boomed, growing at a rate faster than the adoption of the internet. Recently, El Salvador became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender.

**What are the other major companies in this domain?**

Main competitors include, but are not limited to, Cardano, Solana, Polkadot, Tezos and Binance Smart Chain.

## Results

**What has been the business impact of this company so far?**

Ethereum has expanded on the technical innovation of it's predecessor (Bitcoin) to fuel the surge in blockchain technologies and cryptocurrency adoption worldwide. The network has provided the infastructure for thousands of decentralised applications, protecting privacy and removing cencorship for any individual with a mobile device and internet connection.

**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**

Ethereum has a number of metrics which offer an array of insights into how the project is performing. For example the token price is currently trading at $1848 USD, a multiple of 5961 from the original ICO price of $0.31 USD. The network processes an average of over 1 million transactions daily, indicating the popularity among developers and users.

**How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**

Ethereum is currently the second largest cryptocurrency, signifcantly outperforming all competitors.

## Recommendations

**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**

I believe Ethereum is currently on the correct path for success, merging to the PoS mechanism under Eth2.0. Without the upgrade I believe the network would eventually fall to competitors due to high gas fees and slower processing times.

**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**

Ethereum 2.0 will reduce gas fees and speed processing times.

**What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**

Ethereum 2.0 will utilise PoS instead of PoW.

**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**

PoS utilises significant computing power and is unsustainable for scaling the network.
