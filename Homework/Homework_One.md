## Overview and Origin

Ethereum was conceived, by Canadian programmer Vitalik Buterin, in 2013 at just 19 years of age. He published the whitepaper in 2014, titled 'Ethereum: A Next-Genergation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform'. Development commenced in 2014 and the Ethereum network officially went live on 30 July 2015.

*Who are the founders of the company?*

Alongside Vitalik, there were four additional founders of Ethereum in 2013, namely; Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di lorio, Mihai Alisie and Amir Chetrit. In 2014, another three additional founders joined the project, namely; Gavin Wood, Joseph Lubin and Jeffrey Wilcke. 

*How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?*

Vitalik was an early adopter in Bitcoin, co-founding the Bitcoin Magazine in 2011 whilst in College. He became an expert on blockchain technology, travelling around the world to meet with an array of bitcoin developers. He soon realised that bitcoin held severe limitations in terms of functionality, noting the blockchain was utilised solely as a means of decentralised currency. He proposed that a new blockchain, with an inbuilt programming language, could be utilised for a much larger range of decentralised applications. As a result, Ethereum was proposed and solidity was developed as the programming language which powers the network.

*How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?*

Ethereum was funded by an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of Ether Tokens from July-August 2014. Ether is the cryptocurrency which facilitates payments/transactions on the Ethereum network. Individuals purchased Ether utilising bitcoin during the public sale, however did not immediately receive the tokens as the Ethereum blockchain was not yet live. This event was called a "premine", where individuals instead received Ethereum wallets and passwords which would hold their Ether once the network went live. During the ICO, 12 million Ether were premined for developers and 60 million were premined for ICO participants. The price was $0.31 per coin, raising over $16 Million USD for the project. Today the total supply of ETH is curently 120.11M, meaning approximately 60% of the supply was pre-mined.

## Business Activities:

*What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?*

Ethereum was designed to allow for the creation of decentralised applications (dApps) which are trustworthy, transparent and crypto-graphically secure. By removing intermediaries and third parties, dApps provide privacy, remove censorship and reduce or remove uneccessary fees and processing delays. Numerous financial technologies have already been revolutionised utilising Ethereum with examples such as decentralised crypto exchanges, non-fungible-tokens and marketplaces, dentralised finance including lending and borrowing activities and stablecoins. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Ethereum was created to enable developers to build dApps which will ultimately be used in a wide arrange of industries, for customers all across the world. Anyone can interact with the Ethereum network, whether it be developers, users, buyers, sellers, traders, collectors and more. In terms of the Eth token, the cryptocurrency is currently the second largest in the world (second to bitcoin) with a current market cap of $229 Billion USD. The total crypto market is currently $1.14 Trillion USD (as of 2145, 17 Aug 22 AEST), meaning Eth holds a market share of approximately 20%. For reference, the bitcoin market cap is currently $454 Billion USD, equating to a share of approximately 40%.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Ethereum has a number of prominent competitors, the most popular of which is Cardano. After disagreements surrounding the direction of Ethereum, co-founder Charles Hoskinson left the project and launched Cardano. Both networks provide the infastructure to support decentralised applications (along with other competitors such as Solana, Tezos and Polkadot). The main advantage of Ethereum is the sheer market size as a result of being the first to market. Far more developers and customers are utilising the Ethereum network with 1.1 Million daily transactions, compared with only 75 Thousand for Cardano.


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Ethereum utilises blockchain technology
